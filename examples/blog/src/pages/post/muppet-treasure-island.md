Muppet Treasure Island is a 1996 American musical adventure comedy film directed by Brian Henson. It is the fifth theatrical film in The Muppets franchise.

Adapted from the 1883 novel Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, similarly to its predecessor The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992), the key roles were played by live-action actors, with the Muppets in supporting roles. It stars Tim Curry as Long John Silver, and Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins alongside Muppet performers Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Jerry Nelson, Kevin Clash, and Frank Oz portraying various roles.
