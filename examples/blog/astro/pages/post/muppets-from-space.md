Muppets from Space is a 1999 American science fiction comedy film directed by Tim Hill (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Jerry Juhl, Joseph Mazzarino, and Ken Kaufman. The sixth theatrical film in The Muppets franchise, it is the first Muppets film to not be a musical and the first film since the death of Muppets creator Jim Henson to have an original Muppets-focused plot. It stars Jeffrey Tambor, F. Murray Abraham, David Arquette, Pat Hingle, Rob Schneider, Andie MacDowell, Josh Charles, Hulk Hogan, and Ray Liotta, alongside Muppet performers Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Bill Barretta, and Frank Oz. In the film, Gonzo attempts to discover his origins after having nightmares. After he and Rizzo the Rat are captured by government officials during his search, Kermit the Frog and the rest of the Muppet gang must save them.
