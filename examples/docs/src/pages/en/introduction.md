**Welcome to Astro!**

This is the `docs` starter template. It contains all of the features that you need to build a Markdown-powered documentation site, including:

- âœ… **Sidebar navigation**
- âœ… **Search (powered by Algolia)**
- âœ… **Multi-language i18n**
- âœ… (and, best of all) **dark mode**

To get started, check out the project `README.md` that the template came with. It provides documentation on how to use and customize this template for your own project, which you can always refer back to as you build.

Found a missing feature that you can't live without? Please suggest it and even consider adding it yourself to the Astro repo! We're an open source project and contributions from developers like you are how we grow! ðŸ’™
