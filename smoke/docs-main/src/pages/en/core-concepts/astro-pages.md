description: An intro to Astro pages, components that function as full pages.
---

**Pages** are a special type of [Astro Component](/en/core-concepts/astro-components) that handle routing, data loading, and templating for each page of your website. You can think of them like any other Astro component, just with extra responsibilities.

Astro also supports Markdown for content-heavy pages, like blog posts and documentation. See [Markdown Content](/en/guides/markdown-content) for more information on writing pages with Markdown.

## File-based Routing

Astro uses Pages to do something called **file-based routing.** Every file in your `src/pages` directory becomes a page on your site, using the file name to decide the final route.

Astro Components (`.astro`) and Markdown Files (`.md`) are the only supported formats for pages. Other page types (like a `.jsx` React component) are not supported, but you can use anything as a UI component inside of an `.astro` page to achieve a similar result.

```
src/pages/index.astro       -> mysite.com/
src/pages/about.astro       -> mysite.com/about
src/pages/about/index.astro -> mysite.com/about
src/pages/about/me.astro    -> mysite.com/about/me
src/pages/posts/1.md        -> mysite.com/posts/1
```

## Page Templating

All Astro components are responsible for returning HTML. Astro Pages return HTML as well, but have the unique responsibility of returning a full `<html>...</html>` page response, including `<head>` ([MDN<span class="sr-only">- head</span>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head)) and `<body>` ([MDN<span class="sr-only">- body</span>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body)).

`<!doctype html>` is optional, and will be added automatically.

```astro
---
// Example: HTML page skeleton
---
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Data Loading

Astro pages can fetch data to help generate your pages. Astro provides two different tools to pages to help you do this: **fetch()** and **top-level await.**

üìö Read our [full guide](/en/guides/data-fetching) on data-fetching to learn more.

```astro
---
// Example: Astro component scripts run at build time
const response = await fetch('http://example.com/movies.json');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
---
<!-- Output the result to the page -->
<div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>
```

## Custom 404 Error Page

For a custom 404 error page create a `404.astro` file in `/src/pages`. That builds to a `404.html` page. Most [deploy services](/en/guides/deploy) will find and use it.
This is special and different to the default behavior building `page.astro` (or `page/index.astro`) to `page/index.html`.

## Non-HTML Pages

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This feature is currently only supported with the `--experimental-static-build` CLI flag. This feature may be refined over the next few weeks/months as SSR support is finalized.

Non-HTML pages, like `.json` or `.xml`, can be built from `.js` and `.ts`. All that's needed is to export a `get()` function that returns a string `body` with the rendered file contents.

Built filenames and extensions are based on the source file's name, ex: `src/pages/data.json.ts` will be built to match the `/data.json` route in your final build.

```js
// src/pages/company.json.ts
export async function get() {
  return {
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'Astro',
      url: 'https://astro.build/',
    }),
  };
}
```

**Is this different from SSR?** Yes! This feature allows JSON, XML, etc. files to be output at build time. Keep an eye out for full SSR support if you need to build similar files when requested, for example as a serverless function in your deployment host.

### Routing

File-based routing works the same as HTML pages, including dynamic routes with `getStaticPaths()`. See the [routing](/en/core-concepts/routing/) docs for more details.

### Data Loading

The [`Astro` global](/en/reference/api-reference/#astro-global) is only available in `.astro` files. Instead, [`import.meta.glob`](/en/reference/api-reference/#importmeta) can be used to load local `.md` files.

Similar to `.astro` pages, **fetch()** can be used to fetch data. üìö Read our [full guide](/en/guides/data-fetching) on data-fetching to learn more.

### Examples

```typescript
// src/pages/company.json.ts
export async function get() {
  return {
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'Astro Technology Company',
      url: 'https://astro.build/',
    }),
  };
}
```

#### Example with dynamic routes

What about `getStaticPaths()`? It **just works**‚Ñ¢.

```typescript
// src/pages/[slug].json.ts
export async function getStaticPaths() {
    return [
        { params: { slug: 'thing1' }},
        { params: { slug: 'thing2' }}
    ]
}

export async function get(params) {
    const { slug } = params

    return {
        body: // ...JSON.stringify()
    }
}
```
