TODO: astro boilerplate

## 🧞 Development

Add a `dev` npm script to your `/package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev ."
  }
}
```

Then run:

```
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Build & Deployment

Add a `build` npm script to your `/package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev .",
    "build": "astro build ."
  }
}
```

Then run:

```
npm run build
```

Now upload the contents of `/_site_` to your favorite static site host.
