## 0.1.0
### Minor Changes

- b3886c2: Enhanced **Markdown** support! Markdown processing has been moved from `micromark` to `remark` to prepare Astro for user-provided `remark` plugins _in the future_.
  
  This change also introduces a built-in `<Markdown>` component for embedding Markdown and any Astro-supported component format inside of `.astro` files. [Read more about Astro's Markdown support.](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro/blob/main/docs/markdown.md)
