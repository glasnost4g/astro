## Why MDX?

MDX is the defacto solution for embedding components, such as interactive charts or alerts, within Markdown content. If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration makes migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Installation

<details>
  <summary>Quick Install</summary>

The `astro add` command-line tool automates the installation for you. Run one of the following commands in a new terminal window. (If you aren't sure which package manager you're using, run the first command.) Then, follow the prompts, and type "y" in the terminal (meaning "yes") for each one.

  ```sh
  # Using NPM
  npx astro add mdx
  # Using Yarn
  yarn astro add mdx
  # Using PNPM
  pnpx astro add mdx
  ```

Then, restart the dev server by typing `CTRL-C` and then `npm run astro dev` in the terminal window that was running Astro.

Because this command is new, it might not properly set things up. If that happens, [feel free to log an issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

  <summary>Manual Install</summary>

First, install the `@astrojs/mdx` package using your package manager. If you're using npm or aren't sure, run this in the terminal:

  ```sh
  npm install @astrojs/mdx
  ```

Then, apply this integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

__`astro.config.mjs`__

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [mdx()],
});
```

Finally, restart the dev server.

## Usage

To write your first MDX page in Astro, head to our [UI framework documentation][astro-ui-frameworks]. You'll explore:
- üì¶ how framework components are loaded,
- üíß client-side hydration options, and
- ü™Ü opportunities to mix and nest frameworks together

[**Client Directives**](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) are still required in `.mdx` files.

> **Note**: `.mdx` files adhere to strict JSX syntax rather than Astro's HTML-like syntax.

Also check our [Astro Integration Documentation][astro-integration] for more on integrations.

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary><strong>remarkPlugins</strong></summary>

**Default plugins:** [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm), [remark-smartypants](https://github.com/silvenon/remark-smartypants)

[Remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) allow you to extend your Markdown with new capabilities. This includes [auto-generating a table of contents](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc), [applying accessible emoji labels](https://github.com/florianeckerstorfer/remark-a11y-emoji), and more. We encourage you to browse [awesome-remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/awesome-remark) for a full curated list!

We apply [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) and [Smartypants](https://github.com/silvenon/remark-smartypants) by default. This brings some niceties like auto-generating clickable links from text (ex. `https://example.com`) and formatting quotes for readability. When applying your own plugins, you can choose to preserve or remove these defaults.

To apply plugins _while preserving_ Astro's default plugins, use a nested `extends` object like so:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import remarkToc from 'remark-toc';

export default {
  integrations: [mdx({
    // apply remark-toc alongside GitHub-flavored markdown and Smartypants
    remarkPlugins: { extends: [remarkToc] },
  })],
}
```

To apply plugins _without_ Astro's defaults, you can apply a plain array:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import remarkToc from 'remark-toc';

export default {
  integrations: [mdx({
    // apply remark-toc alone, removing other defaults
    remarkPlugins: [remarkToc],
  })],
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>rehypePlugins</strong></summary>

**Default plugins:** none

[Rehype plugins](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) allow you to transform the HTML that your Markdown generates. We recommend checking the [Remark plugin](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) catalog first _before_ considering rehype plugins, since most users want to transform their Markdown syntax instead. If HTML transforms are what you need, we encourage you to browse [awesome-rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/awesome-rehype) for a full curated list of plugins!

To apply rehype plugins, use the `rehypePlugins` configuration option like so:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import rehypeMinifyHtml from 'rehype-minify';

export default {
  integrations: [mdx({
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeMinifyHtml],
  })],
}
```
