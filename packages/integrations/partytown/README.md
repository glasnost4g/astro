# @astrojs/partytown ðŸŽ‰

This **[Astro integration][astro-integration]** enables [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/) in your Astro project.

Partytown is a lazy-loaded library to help relocate resource intensive scripts into a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), and off of the [main thread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_thread).

## Installation

There are two ways to add integrations to your project. Let's try the most convenient option first!

### (experimental) `astro add` command

Astro includes a CLI tool for adding first party integrations: `astro add`. This command will:
1. (Optionally) Install all necessary dependencies and peer dependencies
2. (Also optionally) Update your `astro.config.*` file to apply this integration

To install `@astrojs/partytown`, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

```sh
# Using NPM
npx astro add partytown
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add partytown
# Using PNPM
pnpx astro add partytown
```

If you run into any hiccups, [feel free to log an issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Install dependencies manually

First, install the `@astrojs/partytown` integration like so:

```
npm install @astrojs/partytown
```

Then, apply this integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

__astro.config.mjs__

```js
import partytown from '@astrojs/partytown';

export default {
  // ...
  integrations: [partytown()],
}
```

## Getting started

Partytown should be ready-to-use with zero config. If you have an existing 3rd party script on your site, try adding the `type="text/partytown"` attribute:

```diff
-  <script src="fancy-analytics.js"></script>
+  <script type="text/partytown" src="fancy-analytics.js"></script>
```

If you open the "Network" tab from [your browser's dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/), you should see the `partytown` proxy intercepting this request.

[Head to the Partytown docs](https://partytown.builder.io/configuration) for configuration options and more usage examples. You can also check our [Astro Integration Documentation][astro-integration] for more on integrations.
