## 0.10.0

`astro` has been bumped to `0.10.0` to avoid conflicts with the previously published `astro` package (which was graciously donated to us at `v0.9.2`).

### Minor Changes

- b3886c2: Enhanced **Markdown** support! Markdown processing has been moved from `micromark` to `remark` to prepare Astro for user-provided `remark` plugins _in the future_.

  This change also introduces a built-in `<Markdown>` component for embedding Markdown and any Astro-supported component format inside of `.astro` files. [Read more about Astro's Markdown support.](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro/blob/main/docs/markdown.md)
