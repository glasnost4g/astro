If you wish to learn more about the range of methods to install and setup Astro for your project's, please [read our installation guide.](installation)

## Start your project

From inside your project directory, enter the following command into your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Astro will now start serving your application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Opening this URL in your browser, you should see the Astro's "Hello, World".

The server will listen for live file changes in your `src/` directory, so you do not need to restart the application as you make changes during development.

## Build your project

To build your project, from inside your directory enter the following build command into your terminal:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will instruct Astro to build your site and save it directly to disk. Your application is now ready in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy your project

Astro sites are static, so they can be deployed to your favourite host:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Read more about deploying Astro in our Deploy guide.](/guides/deploy)
